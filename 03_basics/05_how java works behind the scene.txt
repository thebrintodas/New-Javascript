            Javascript Execution Context
         ----------------------------------

How Javascript runs the file that has been executed?

CODE -> makes global execution context -> refers in 'this'

1) Global Execution Context
2) Function Execution Context
3) Eval Execution Context(Part Of Global)

CODE -> Memory Creation Phase
     -> Execution Phase
Let a code:

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addNum(num1,num2){
   let total = num1 + num2
   return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1,val2)
let result2 = addNum(10,2)

STEPS:

1) CODE -> makes global execution context

2) Memory Creation Phase:

   val1 -> undefined
   val2 -> underfined
   addNum -> definition
   result1 -> undefined
   result2 -> undefined

3) Execution Phase:

   val1 -> 10
   val2 -> 5
   addNum -> [new variable environment + execution thread
               -> Memory Phase:

                  val1 -> undefined
                  val2 -> undefined
                  total -> undefined

               -> Execution Context:   
                  
                  num1 -> 10
                  num2 -> 5
                  total -> 15 (will be returned in the global execution conetext)

               (Deleted after execution) ]
   
   Same will be repeated for result2.
